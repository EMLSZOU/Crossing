In a broader sense, understanding to the core that, neither are you perfect, nor is everybody else, accepting the same and being tolerant of and forgiving others, and most importantly yourself, is maturity.

Maturity is falling down, giving yourself time to cry out loud in times of disparity, wiping out all yours tears and getting up again with every ounce of strength left in your body.

Maturity is the realization of your weaknesses and strengths and accepting yourself wholeheartedly for what you are and others for what they are.

Maturity is living and letting live.
